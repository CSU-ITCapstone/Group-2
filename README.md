## Description
The Printer Management Portal is a web-based application designed to streamline printer administration by pulling records from an SQL database and displaying them on a web page. The portal will offer an intuitive interface for users to add, update, and delete printer records such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, drivers, and more.
